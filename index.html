      Introduction
    </h2>

    <p>
      Hi! I'm Hugo Thompson, and here's a little bit about myself. I first started coding in 2017 right in the middle of highschool, and I realized
      that it's actually a lot of fun. I kept learning code throughout highschool until I graduated in 2019, when Covid-19 struck. I decided to take
      a break year because hey this Covid thing is really going to hamper the university experience, and I got all my tools right here for me to keep
      learning! Only, maybe I was underestimating how long Covid would take to move on, because now we're here, and I decided to join CodeFellows to
      get some official education to fill in the holes in what I know from self learning.
    </p>
